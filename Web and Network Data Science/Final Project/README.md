## Nature & Environment Team – Final Report
### Problem Statement
The growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market, has been fueled by the economic feasibility of Lithium-ion battery production and technology improvements, as well as customer demand for affordable, high-performance vehicles with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Chevrolet, producer of the EV Bolt has concerns about US sales to date. While not selling as well as expected in 2017, sales seem to be rebounding in early 2018. Management wants to track changes in consumer perception, search strategies, and market strength, relative to several competitors (Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S). This will allow Chevrolet to engage in more targeted consumer marketing strategies, and better position the brand for continued sales growth.

### Data Gathering Methods
Several data gathering approaches (using various Pyhton web scraping scripts) were used to:
a) Compile and analyze historical EV Car Sales data for Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3
b) Website Structure & Content using (using NLTK library): created a text file with keywords for various EV models. We also identified a classification of “energy” words, that includes: energy, charging, battery, electric and Plug. In addition, an analysis of the sitemaps of the Chevy Bolt versus its competitors was performed.
c) Search Rankings & Site Search Analysis: Using Google Trends search interest data over time, we have compared the search query for the main brand terms for each in the competitor set on exact match: Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model 3, & Electric Car as a comparison point.
d) Social Media: Using the Twitter API a sentiment analysis is being performed to evaluate relative consumer sentiment between the Chevy Bolt and its competitor brands.

### Conclusions
From the results from the website content, we would recommend including more details about the driving experience and aesthetics of the car, discussing more it’s appeal and new trending technological features. In addition, the website structure needs to be developed further to add more nuance, and utilities to prospective EV buyers in different geographical regions, such as providing details of locations of charging stations and model specifications. In terms of site search, there might be some advantages to using paid search on more non-brand terms as there is not a lot of competition, but a steady amount of traffic.
