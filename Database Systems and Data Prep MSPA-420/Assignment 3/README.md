### Assignment 3: Overview
Create two data "assets" for use by the XYZ company in direct marketing campaigns. Download data from a SSCC server to your local computer, create a relational database for it that you'll store locally, and create a "flat" file with selected customers and variables. You'll document your work by providing the code you used and some summaries of the data. You'll save the new assets you created for future use and for sharing with others.

This assignment requires use of the NU cluster and a Postgres server running on it, Python and the pandas package, and the sqlite database.
