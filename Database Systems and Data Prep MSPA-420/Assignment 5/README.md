You have the use of your previously manipulated air transportation data. New data are from the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (USDOT) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The available data was used to do the following:

1. Determine for the airports LAX, SFO, ATL, MIA, and JFK how many passenger departures and arrivals they each had in 2014, and which airline was each airport's largest departure carrier and the largest arrival carrier.
2. For each of these airports, determine what airports the largest number of arrivals were from, and the airport that the largest number of departures went to.
3. For each of these airports, determine the number of accidents or incidents that occurred at them between 2010 and 2014 inclusive, according to the FAA. Determine the number of deaths that occurred in each event for each of these five airports.
4. Determine what the top ten (primary) causes of 2010-2014 incidents and accidents are for all events resulting in deaths regardless of where they occurred. Provide descriptions (not codes) for the causes.
