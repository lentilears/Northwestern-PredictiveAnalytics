0,luvsroadtrips,"This place is not even suitable for the homeless take my advice and stay far far away! We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!! GROSS...... seriously need a hazmat suit to enter.","January 3, 2012"
1,estelle e,We stayed in downtown hotel Seattle for two night. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms wee very clean. Just minutes away from union street and 5th avenue. Starucks coffee next door. 24 hour room service was extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered pizza to our hotel at 12am. we had a good experience.,"December 29, 2011"
2,RobertEddy,"i made reservations and when i showed up, i quickly started laughing at how pathetic is was. first, they didnt even have parking near the hotel. second, i asked if they had wi-fi and they replied enthusiastically,"" we have it in the lobby!"" how is that even a perk? finally, i said screw this place for these rates and left. the manager offered other places and followed me to the door. the next day, they charged me for the reserved room and said that i was a no show! the people are rude and have not given my money back yet. they should post their business as a motel at the very least! all i can say is never again!","December 20, 2011"
3,James R,"This hotel is so bad it's a joke. I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables. The elevator crawls up squeeking the whole way with no certificate of inspection or weight limit posted. The room looks like somethig out of the 70s. Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading. Any positive reviews seem like ownership tring to do damage control on the reviews.","October 30, 2011"
4,Shobha49,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 16th July to 18th July. We selected this hotel purely for the excellent location and for the cost. But frankly we were in for a shock when we arrived at the hotel directly after disembarking from a cruise. There was only one person at the front desk and he bluntly told us that check-in was only after 3pm. Since it was a long wait (we reached the hotel at 11am) we requested that we be allowed to leave our luggage. Luckily he agreed., So we left and returned only later in the evening. There was only one lift and that was so ancient just like everythinhg at the hotel. The room was smelling awful and looked very dull and unwelcoming. There was free wifi only in the lobby. The bathroom was only just adequate as the toilet seat was wobbly and almost broken. There was no kettle or microwave anywhere in the hotel. We just managed to survive for two nights only because it was conveniently located to the Pyke Marketplace ,space needle and the sea front. Luckily there were good restaurants and Starbucks close by . I will think twice before staying again at this hotel","September 14, 2011"
5,PalomitaBlanca,"Very basic hotel and good rate compared to most of the hotels in the area. Stayed here for 3 nights. Excellent staff that was very friendly and helpful. Very central to everything in downtown Seattle. Could definitely use a revamp (lobby, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc). Nonetheless I'd stay here again because the price was very affordable.","September 6, 2011"
6,Qualnurse,"We stayed for one night, before a cruise to Alaska leaving from Seattle. We had previously stayed at the Warwick, and this hotel did not have near the same comfort level, but was still very comfortable and within walking distance of Pikes Placed market and other downtown attractions. We will definitely stay again!","September 6, 2011"
7,Debbie R,"Stay here if you want to experenice hell. Joel is the manger,an know help want so ever. Put me on the 10th floor even though he knew I don't like elevators. Then told the staff not to move me.","August 27, 2011"
8,travelitch_gal,"If you are looking for a value for money hotel, this would be it. It is a no frills hotel. The room and bathroom are clean. You can only use the wifi at the hotel lobby so it is rather troublesome if you need the Internet frequently. The staff are friendly too so that is a plus.","August 23, 2011"
9,Khaap,"This hotel had character! I really liked our room too. It was tiny but fun. Very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. If you need space to spread out this isn't the place for you but if you plan on enjoying the room just as a place to drop your things and go enjoy the city than this is the perfect place. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hallways made me feel like I was in a dream. I loved the decor!! Very artistic, not like any other place I have ever stayed. I was a little concerned because I had seen that this hotel was listed on the bed bug report. I called ahead of time to inquire about this issue. I spoke to the general manager who told me that bed bugs have now come to Seattle and they are a problem in the industry and any hotel at any time could have them. He also assured me that they bring in dogs to check the rooms on a regular basis and if any are found they are properly exterminated. I don't think you can ask for anything else. We had no bed bugs in our room! Yea! Anyhow the place is great! I would go back for sure. Give them a try.","August 10, 2011"
10,Trini007,"If old, torn and stained linen, towels, bedsheets gives you a thrill, you'd love this hotel. If you never iron your clothes, youd love this hotel as there are no irons in the rooms. If you feel that rusted bathroom and showers that dont work gives you an excellent reason to skip a shower, you'd love this hotel. If you think that a hotel that has no airconditioning in the rooms is a great opportunity to get fresh air, you'd love this hotel. If you think that having only 3 channels on tv to choose from is great, you'd love this hotel. If you think that ""identify that carpet stain"" is a great game to play with family and friends, you'd love this hotel. If you think that massive holes in the ceiling and walls in the room means that our dear rodents friends wont be bored or hungry, you'll love this hotel. I could go on, but I think you get the picture here.","July 29, 2011"
11,rtl2,"The hotel is in a very convenient location, just a few steps from the University Street stop on the transit tunnel for free city centre busses or light rail. The price was very reasonable. The hotel was clean with regards to day to day cleaning - the lobby, corridors, toilet, shower were all clean, and the room was dust free with fresh smelling sheets on the bed, which whilst it was not the most comfy bed I have ever slept in it was OK. Deeper down bits of the hotel have seen better days. There was a rusty pipe and loose wallpaper in the corner of both my friends bathroom and my bathroom, both of our bathrooms had filthy suspended ceilings, there was also a bit of loose wallpaper in my bedroom and the TVs only worked on a few channels, in my room only one non religious channel in fact, and that was the ""Opra Winfrey Network"" - could not get any morning weather or news. Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router. No breakfast in the hotel, they reccomend you go to the restaurant underneath for breakfast but it sounded expensive to us so we went to a nearby Subway instead. This hotel was OK for us for the price as we spent very little time in the hotel except when asleep. I would not have wanted to spend an extended amount of time in the room though.","July 18, 2011"
12,PDXKev,I stayed here overnight after attending the U2 concert recently. It was really bad! They didn't even have an alarm clock in the room. It's way overpriced. About the only thing good is that the location is quite convenient.,"June 7, 2011"
13,lindseypie,"My husband and I decided to stay at Hotel Seattle because of the price and the location. But in the end, it probably would have been cheaper for us to stay at one of the nicer hotels a block over. There's no parking at this hotel, which meant we had to spend 30 bucks at a parking garage. Also, there's no internet in the rooms and our T.V. didn't work. Definitely a BIG disappointment.","May 22, 2011"
14,MaxStevens101,"I am just a college student visiting Seattle, and without looking into greater detail about the hotel I was making reservations with, I got stuck with Hotel Seattle. I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in. No human being deserves to stay in such a mold-infested dump. OH YEAH- pay $10 for wifi for one day.","April 17, 2011"
15,jcoken,"I would never do business with this hotel. I had a room booked for Friday night because the Marriott was unavailable. Turns out that they had a hotel room and I was able to stay. I called the Hotel Seattle at 10:00pm the night before and they refused to cancel my room. Yes their check in policy is 2:00pm and yes I was 8 hours late, but generally most hotels, who rely on travelers to book their rooms, are more than happy to work with you. Unfortunately not these guys.","April 15, 2011"
16,SQLTravller,"I was unfortunately booked into this dump by my corporate travel office, I have filed a human rights complaint. This place was probably a dump 20 years ago, its better days are long gone. DO NOT PAY TO STAY HERE, there are nice hotel in the area for comparable rates.","November 17, 2010"
17,RTiara,"I called my husband in a panic before I even got in the elevator. The lobby was creepy, dark, old and in need of repair. My room had lights that stopped working in the bathroom, carpet was dirty, tv did not work, and the carpet was dingy. I was afraid to sleep with the lights off. The street noise is so loud I could not sleep all night. When I opened the curtains in the morning, the curtain rod came loose. If I hadnt already paid for the room on a discount website that showed pictures of a newly remodeled hotel room, I would have never stayed.... I wish I had read previous reviews before I came to Seattle.","September 19, 2010"
18,ATL012,"We checked in, saw the room and checked back out. I can't add anymore to the description of the ugly, mold infested, creepy room than what has already been said from other reviewers. But I can tell you that it wasn't easy to find another hotel room on a Saturday afternoon. After calling nearly every hotel downton, we lucked out and wound up paying over $200 for the last room available at the Hampton Inn (which was beautiful). But I still shudder at the memory of my very short stay at the Hotel Seattle.","September 3, 2010"
