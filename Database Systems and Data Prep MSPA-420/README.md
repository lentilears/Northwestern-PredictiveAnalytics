## Overview
This is a 'virtual Python Coding Lab'. Behind every analytics project is one or more analytical data sources. Introduces fundamentals of data management and data preparation through weekly graded assignments: specifically, hands-on experience with various data file formats, working with quantitative data and text, relational (e.g. SQL) database systems, and NoSQL database systems (e.g MongoDB). Access, organize, clean, prepare, transform, and explore data, using database shells, query and scripting languages, and analytical software. The data for assignments are stored in various formats, and are about things like customer transactions, air travel and accidents, and corporate email analysis (e.g. Enron).

### Learning Goals
1. Articulate analytics as a core strategy using examples of successful predictive modeling/data mining applications in various industries.
2. Formulate and manage plans to address business issues with analytics.
3. Define key terms, concepts and issues in data management and database management systems with respect to predictive modeling.
4. Evaluate the constraints, limitations and structure of data through data cleansing, preparation and exploratory analysis to create an analytical database. 
5. Use object-oriented scripting software for data preparation.
6. Transform data into actionable insights through data exploration.
